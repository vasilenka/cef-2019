              <strong>(i) Invited speakers and guests</strong> will hear from the Secretariat regarding their accommodation and logistical support.  The Organizer will cover the costs for five nights (check in on August 19, 2019, check out on August 24, 2019), unless otherwise agreed.  The Secretariat will announce further details soon.

              <strong>(ii) Not an invited speaker:</strong> You are responsible for your own accommodation. Surakarta is full of reasonably-priced accommodations and different parts of the city are easily accessible on foot or using taxi services (including app-based provider like Go-Jek and Grab). It is recommended that you utilize various online booking sites (e.g. Traveloka/Tiket.com, Booking.com, Agoda.com, etc). For queries, you can send us an email at <Email /> and weâ€™d be happy to help.
